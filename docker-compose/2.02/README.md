# Exercise
# 2.2. Simple service with browser
## Instructions

The familiar image devopsdockeruh/simple-web-service can be used to start a web service, see the exercise 1.10.

Create a docker-compose.yml, and use it to start the service so that you can use it with your browser.

Read about how to add the command to docker-compose.yml from the documentation(opens in a new tab).
Submit the docker-compose.yml, and make sure that it works simply by running docker compose up

## commands
```
docker compose up
```

## output
```
{
  "message": "You connected to the following path: /",
  "path": "/"
}
