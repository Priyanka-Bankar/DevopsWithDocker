# Exercise
# 2.3. Project with compose (mandatory exercise)
## Instructions
As we saw previously, starting an application with two programs was not trivial and the commands got a bit long.

In the previous part we created Dockerfiles for both frontend(opens in a new tab) and backend(opens in a new tab) of the example application. Next, simplify the usage into one docker-compose.yml.

Configure the backend and front end to work in Docker Compose, as in Exercise 1.14(opens in a new tab). If the button for Exercise 1.14 works, your setup is correct.

You may assume that the images are readily built and available (locally or in Docker Hub).

Submit the docker-compose.yml

## commands
```
docker compose up
```
